# Regression

This project uses linear regression to determine how certain features affect house price.
Linear regression is a method for fitting a linear function over data to both explain the current data and predict future data values. The two components we will use to evaluate our Linear model are R squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
R squared is the percentage of the dependent variable, in our case price, that can be explained by our model.
MSE is the average distance of the data from the model and represents the dependent variable.
